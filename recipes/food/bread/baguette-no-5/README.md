* **3g**, Active dry yeast (2 tsp).
* **12g**, Kosher salt (2 tsp).

### Tools

* Scale for measuring, or measuring cups.
* Stand mixer with bowl, or your plain ol’ hands for mixing.
* Plastic bowl scraper, or plastic spoon for mixing bowl.
* Metal dough scraper to clean flour off flat surface.
* Olive oil for greasing bowl (about 5g).

* Glass bowl for storage.
* Baguette pan, baking sheet, or baking stone for storage/baking.
* Cast iron skillet for ice.
* Ice cubes.

## Recipe

Note: This recipe will get you 90% of the way there. The science of working with dough is so fickle that it’s unlikely that you will be able to reproduce the temperature my house was in, the weight of the water I used depending on what region of the world you live in, temperature of the resting dough, etc. No recipe is ever completely foolproof so take the liberty to adjust any values to your needs and take notes as you make and remake this bread.

1. On a scale, place mixing bowl. Add **420g** bread flour and **340g** (45°C / 110°F) warm water. Mix with hands and clean any sticky dough from your hands using extra flour (this is a good way to preserve dough without washing it away on a sink). cover the mixing bowl with a towel or plastic wrap and store in an enclosed space (like a microwave or oven) for about 15 minutes. This will begin the autolyse phase (which will make the dough easier to handle).

2. Remove the mixing bowl from the enclosed space and add **12g** kosher salt, and **3g** dry yeast. Knead the dough until you no longer feel the salt inbetween your fingers. Allow the dough to rest for 1-2 hours covered and returned to the enclosed space. The dough should roughly double in size but try to be mindful not to extend the time. If air leaks out of the dough and it looks like a bubbly blob (and not a big round ball), then you allowed the dough to overproof and allowing it to overproof into a more acidic bread.

3. After the second rest, transfer the dough to a flat surface. Fold the dough into itself a few times and slowly start pulling on the sides gradually as you fold. As you pull, you can use your hands to twist the dough to create something of a screw shape. Lightly flour a baguette pan or baking sheet and place dough on top. Cover with tea towels or a bread couche for one last rest -this rest is to create the bread rise/shape.

4. Heat oven to **245°Celsius / 475°Fahrenheit**. In a separate cast iron skillet, fill with ice and set to the side.

5. Score the top of the bread with a knife. If using a baguette pan, just place it into the oven, otherwise, transfer the bread to a baking sheet trying to not agitate the dough shape too much. Place the cast iron with ice into the oven alongside or under the bread.

6. Bake bread for **18-20** minutes at 245°Celsius / 475°Fahrenheit or until the bread starts to start getting a deep brown color around the body.

7. Remove bread and let rest for a few minutes before cutting and serving.

8. Enjoy.
