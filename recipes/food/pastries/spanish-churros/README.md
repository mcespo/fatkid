# Spanish Churros

I love churros! Spanish, Mexican, whateves - I'll take it. The version that most is to my style is the Spanish iteration which is just a plain flour churro with water.

## Ingredients

### Items

Note: measurements under 5g may be slightly inaccurate without an expensive precision scale, or a milligram scale. Consider using teaspoon measurements in these instances.

* **10g (1tbsp)**, Sugar.
* **6g (1tsp)** Kosher salt.
* **10g (1tbsp)**, Olive oil.
* **4g (1tsp)** Vanilla extract.
* **415ml (1.75 cup)**, Water.
* **4g (1tsp)** Baking powder.
* **210g** Bread Flour.
* Vegetable oil.

### Tools

* Scale for measuring, OR measuring cups.
* Pot for churro dough
* Pot for oil
* A lid of some sort to partially cover oil pot (look, sometimes hot oil can surprise you)
* Wooden spoon OR something firm that can scrape the bottom of the pot without scratching.
* Stand mixer with bowl and paddle attachment.
* Heavy duty pastry bags or a cookie press (I use an Italian butter cookie press with a large star tip).
* Parchment paper.
* Refrigerator.
* Tongs
* Oil thermometer
* Stovetop.

### Recipe

1. In a pot, add **10g (1tbsp)**, sugar, **6g (1tsp)** kosher salt, **10g (1tbsp)**, olive oil, **4g (1tsp)** vanilla extract, and **415ml (1.75 cup)**, water.

2. On a separate bowl, add * **4g (1tsp)** baking powder, and **210g** bread Flour.

3. Prepare a stand mixer with paddle attachment.

4. get some parchment paper on a sheet tray ready, optionally oil with a spray.

5. Turn on the fire on the pot and wait for water to boil.

6. Once the water begins to boil, turn off the heat and add the flour mixture into the boiling pot. Stir vigorously.

7. Once the flour water mixture becomes a well incorporated hot dough, scrape and transfer dough immediately to the stand mixer. At this point, you can add some water to the empty pot to make cleanup a little easier,

8. Use the stand mixer to continue combining the dough for a minute or so.

9. Using a spoon, scrape the stand mixer dough to either a piping bag with a star tip or heavy duty cookie press.

10. Begin piping the dough onto the parchment lined sheet tray.

11. Transfer the tray to the refrigerator to rest or just leave in some spot to cool. You can use this time to prepare a pot for your oil as well as prepare your chocolate ganache. The ganache recipe is on a different page.

12. You can either clean the pot used to make your dough, or use a new pot to prepare the oil. Either way, get a pot ready and use enough vegetable oil to ensure your dough has at least an inch of room to float. Turn on the heat and ensure the oil reaches **375** Fahrenheit (or **190** Celsius).

13. Remove the churros from their resting area and slowly transfer a few into the oil, careful to not burn yourself nor overcrowd the pot. **Note** Consider covering half the pot of oil in the event possible steam pockets don't accidentally burst (I'm not implying that this is possible or that I have scars on my face to prove that this can happen - it's just hypothetical :grimacing:).

14. After 4 minutes, flip the churros and continue to cook until churros develop a golden color. Remove and let rest over a paper towel lined bowl or plate.

15. If the ganache in a bowl was prepped prior, now would be a good time to slightly rewarm it (A microwave set to 50% power for 30 seconds should do the trick).

16. Serve the churros with chocolate ganache on the side.

### If you are looking for a cinnamon sugar mixture because it's what the gods would have wanted:
* **150g (3/4cup)**, sugar
* **6g (1 heaping tsp)**, cinnamon

In a wide enough bowl to fit churros, mix the sugar cinnamon mixture.

### For a quick no nonsense chocolate ganache
* **100g**, Bitter-sweet chocolate chips.
* **125g**, Heavy cream.
* **1 pinch**, Kosher salt.

Combine all ingredients in a bowl and microwave for 30 second increments at 50% power. Mix after each cycle until chocolate is melted. WARNING: You **WILL** burn the chocolate if you run your microwave at full power. 50% and 30 second increments. Do not challenge this step.
