# Muddy Buddies (Puppy Chow)

When I am weirdly stressed out at work, I find myself having really odd cravings. If you have a box of Chex, or Life, you too can feel my anxiety quelling treat.

## Ingredients

### Items

* **175g (1 cup)**, bittersweet chocolate
* **140g (1/2 cup)**, peanut butter
* **60g (4 tbsp)**, butter
* **3g (1/2 tsp)**, kosher salt
* **4g (1 tsp)**, vanilla extract
* **370g (8 cups, or one standard box)** Chex or Life Cereal
* **200g (1 1/2 cup)** confectioners / powdered sugar

### Tools

* Scale for measuring, OR measuring cups.
* Gallon ziplock bag for mixing.
* Large round mixing bowl for cereal.
* An optional ziplock or large bowl to pour the completed muddy buddies.
* Rubber or silicone spoon for folding cereal.
* Microwave safe bowl for chocolate mixture.
* Spoon or whisk to mix chocolate.
* Microwave (and your ability to adjust power levels on said microwave).

## Recipe

1. In a gallon ziplock bag, add half of the confectioners sugar **100g (3/4 cup)** and set aside.

2. In a large mixing bowl, pour **370g (8 cups, or one standard box)** Chex or Life Cereal. Set aside.

3. In a microwave safe bowl, combine: **175g (1 cup)**, bittersweet chocolate, **140g (1/2 cup)**, peanut butter, and **60g (4 tbsp)**, butter. Place this in the microwave

**NOTE**: I don't own your microwave model. It is very likely that you need to adjust the time, power levels to best match your setup. So do not leave your chocolate unattended, otherwise it will burn and melt onto the plate. :grimacing:

4. Set to a 1 minute timer at a power level of 5 (or half of your microwave's full power capacity). If unsure of power levels or timing, drop this to 30 seconds instead until you learn your microwave

5. Stir the mixture and ensure that the melt is happening at a slowly without charring any chocolate. Add back into the microwave for 1 additional minute.

6. Stir once more. If there are some bits of chocolate that have not fully melted, continue to microwave using 30 second intervals, ensuring you stir and check between each interval.

7. After the chocolate/peanut butter mixture seems melted and fully blended, add **3g (1/2 tsp)**, kosher salt, and **4g (1 tsp)**, vanilla extract. Slightly mix.

8. Pour the chocolate/peanut butter mixture into the large mixing bowl that has the cereal. Very gently fold the chocolate over the cereal using a rubber or silicone spoon as to not smash the cereal.

9. Pour half of the chocolate cereal mixture into the ziplock bag containing the sugar. Seal the bag and gently shake until most of the powdered sugar has adhered onto the cereal.

**NOTE**: You can either transfer the ziplock cereal onto a new large bowl OR if you don't want to dirty any additional items, add the remaining cereal, pour the remaining powdered sugar, and continue mixing. The bag itself will be overcrowded but I leave that decision in your capable hands. For now, lets pretend you are using an additional bowl for serving.

10. Pour the half mixture onto a serving bowl. Add the remaining sugar and chocolate cereal into the bag. Repeat the shaking process and transfer to bowl. You can keep this in the fridge using the powdered sugar mixing bag if you prefer.
