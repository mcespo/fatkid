# Espresso

Espresso is a fucking nightmare. There are so so many variables when measuring. I currently use a Rok Espresso press and as a result, my portafilter and extraction is already just real different from any other brand of espresso machine. That said, I will just make one overall assumption: Your single shot of espresso will be something that produces 30ml of liquid (otherwise known as 1oz or 2 tablespoons). Beyond that, you do you. I don't care what you have 

Some names will get real confusing  particularly when we arrive at Spanish recipes. Spanish coffee takes a whole new meaning when compared against their counterparts in the Americas. Cuba, Central America, and Spain will share similar names to drinks with wildly different definitions. All this is to say that think about where you are when you make an order, or at the very least ask what a particular drink contains. The recipes below are the best I can do with the gargantuan amount of conflicting opinions that exist in the ether.



## Extraction variations

### Espresso (Single shot, Café solo)

A single shot of espresso served in an espresso glass.

* **1oz** (30ml), Espresso.
* Served in an espresso glass, or demitasse mug.

### Ristretto

A single shot of espresso using less water during extraction.

* **½oz**, (15ml) Espresso.
* Served in an espresso glass, or demitasse mug.

### Lungo

* **1½oz** (45ml), Espresso.
* Served in an espresso glass, or demitasse mug.

### Doppio (Café doble)

A double shot of espresso served in a demitasse mug.

* **2oz** (60ml), Espresso.
* Served in a demitasse mug.



## Water variations

This is a tricky subcategory but with one definitive rule: You still are working with a typical shot of espresso of some kind and adding additional water as opposed to modifying the initial extraction.

### Americano

* **1oz** (30ml), Espresso.
* **3-4oz** (90-120ml), Hot water.

### Café Con Hielo (Coffee with Ice)

Spain. This is more a ritual than a drink. Serve a 6oz cup of coffee (you can also make an Americano). On a separate glass, fill with ice. Mix a spoonful or so of sugar in your coffee. Pour coffee over ice cubed glass. Drink quickly.

* **6oz** (176ml), coffee.
* Sugar to taste.
* Ice cubes.
* Served in a standard thick glass with cubes.



## Item variations

Sugar, marshmallows, lemon slices, and everything in between. Want to accentuate your espresso or coffee? These are general item variations that do not include milk of any kind for anyone who may have issues with milk-based products.

### Espresso Romano

Not actually Roman. A shot of espresso served with a slice of lemon on the side. the lemon can be expressed on the rim of the glass prior to serving.

* **1oz** (30ml), Espresso.
* **1 slice** lemon.
* Served in an espresso glass, or demitasse mug with lemon slice beside it.

### Guillermo

Probably Spain (no one wants to admit to this madness).A shot of hot espresso poured over lime slices, sometimes served on ice or with sugar.


### Caffe Gommosa (Rubbery coffee)

From the Pacific Northwest of the United States, Caffe Gommosa is espresso poured over a single (¼ oz) regular sized marshmallow or 14 mini marshmallows. You can also reduce to seven toasted mini marshmallows using a chef's torch (my personal preference).

* **1oz** (30ml), Espresso.
* **7** Toasted mini marshmallows.
* Served in an espresso glass, or demitasse mug.

Cafe Cubano – Originally from Cuba, this coffee drink is an espresso that has demerara sugar added.

### Cortadito (Cuban style)

Cuba. A Cortadito is a bit of a process but you will be rewarded for your labor with a sugar bomb. In a wide espresso mug, pour a teaspoonful of sugar, and a few drops of espresso and mix with a little spoon, a baby spoon, a tiny whisk, whatever. Gradually add more drops and continue mixing until you have a coffee paste. Once your paste is completed, add the reminder of the espresso and you should have some crema form at the top of the mug. Success!

Note: Most if not all cuban recipes call for a Cortadito in place of espresso.

Double Note: If you cant be bothered, a teaspoon of condensed milk will not be the same, but it sure does taste good.

* **1oz** (30ml), Espresso.
* **1-2tsp** sugar (can unofficially be substituted for sweetened condensed milk).
* Served in an espresso glass, or demitasse mug.

### Cafe Zorro
A double shot of espresso added to water using a 1:1 ratio.


## Milk Variations

Note: From personal experimentation, you can completely substitute nearly all of these with oat milk and be genuinely satisfied (and in turn make this category fully vegan). Just be careful with items that call for condensed milk, as that is a reduced milk and sugar concentrate.

Milk and coffee are basically the holy grail of coffee. The fat and subtle sweetness of milk adds so much charm to espresso and turns any bitter coffee into a rich palace of wonder.

### Cortado

Spain. Espresso cut with a small amount of warm milk to reduce the acidity. Serving this in a glass is what separates it from a caffè macchiato.

* **1oz** (30ml), Espresso.
* **12oz** (15ml), warm milk.
* Served ONLY in an espresso glass.

### Cortadito (Condensed milk)

Modified Cuban Cortadito using condensed milk to mix into the espresso. Though it will not produce the same crema as a Cuban Cortadito, the richness from the condensed milk really makes this variation worth talking about.

* **1oz** (30ml), Espresso.
* **1-2tsp** Sweetened condensed milk


### Cafe Bombon
Spain. Served in a glass, condensed milk sits at the bottom and espresso is poured above.

Antoccino
A single shot of espresso served with steamed milk in a 1:1 ratio.

Cafe con Leche (Spanish Antoccino)
A single shot of espresso served with steamed milk in a 1:1 ratio.

Cuban Cafe con Leche
A single shot of espresso served with steamed milk in a 1:1 ratio.

### Espresso con panna (Café Vienne, Café Viennois, Café Suizo)
Espresso topped with whipped cream.

* **2oz** (3\60ml), Espresso.
* Whipped cream.
* Served in an espresso glass, or demitasse mug.

Breve
Espresso served with half milk and half cream.

Cafe au lait
Strong coffee made with scalded milk in a 1:1 ratio.
