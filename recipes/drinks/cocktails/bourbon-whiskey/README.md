# Bourbon, Whiskey, Scotch

I really don't want to go into the history of whiskey as it's rather storied. The extremely crude version is distillation gets sort of discovered in 2000-sh BCE. Moors know it, then Christian's learn it, use it for ceremonies, and medicines.

Whiskey distillation starts in Europe between Scotland and Ireland via traveling monks. King Henry VIII says no to religion, the monks turn whiskey distillation into a job.

It his the New World. Moonshining is the new hotness in 'Merica, 'bucnha stuff happens and in 1791, the "whiskey tax" gets imposed on American moonshiners. Things get dicey between Moonshiners and George Washington.

Sour mash gets developed in US which becomes the foundation for Tennessee whiskey.

1840 corn whiskey gets the name Bourbon.

1850s we get blended whisky comes into production.

1964, United States Congress declared bourbon as the official distilled spirit and set up bunch rules on what separates whiskey from bourbon.

2000's onward - It's all pretty much the same but kinda not. Certain alcohols mix better than others. Learn your favorite whiskeys, take risks, and have fun.

Let's get to drinkin'!
