# Cocktails

Oh ho ho. Welcome frands. This is a collection of cocktails without the fancy pics, and extremely long winded story to go with it. This list is constantly evolving and changing the better I get at making cocktails. This list is categorized by their primary alcohol, and individual recipes are read as the top item (or less expensive item) goes in the glass first, all the way down until we get to the primary alcohol at the end, followed by a garnish. That said, decide your own measurements, ingredients, garnishes, etc. to your liking. Don't worry too much and just make something.

Also, follow How to Drink by [Greg Titian and friends](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCioZY1p0bZ4Xt-yodw8_cBQ). This series changed my life, and a majority of the items here are from this Youtube channel.

Some quick tips about cocktails:

* If the cocktail is almost exclusively alcohol (not counting bitters or syrups), that drink will most likely be stirred and served neatly in a presentable coupe glass, or with large ice cube in a cocktail glass.
* If the cocktail uses a juice (lemon, lime, grapefruit, etc). It's common to shake the drink and strain into a coupe glass.
* Garnishes often are often comprised of a fruit or plant that was used in the drink itself (lime wedge if drink used lime juice), or an item that compliments the taste of the cocktail (olives in a Martini).
* For the sake of not spilling or making a mistake too early on, add your cheap ingredients into the glass first as you can still correct for any errors prior to adding the alcohol.
* Don't get hung up on the stuff above. Mix glasses, add ice to non-iced drinks, whatever. Just take the time into making something presentable. Your friends will appreciate it.
* Make your own syrups and avoid using pre-made juices or sweet/sour mixes. Squeeze your own lemons. It makes a difference.
* Take your alcohols seriously. Don't buy very cheap or very expensive alcohols unless you like the taste (Learn your palette).
* Don't drink to get drunk. Alcohol is fun, but alcoholism is serious and should never be taken lightly. Enjoy cocktails to feel like a pretentious ass and get a nice buzz in the process, not to be an asshole and make people feel uncomfortable.

Drinks below are categorized by their base alcohol and if I recall the source, will be provided in the parenthesis.

## Base Alcohols

I used to have a myriad of cocktails in this section. Unfortunately, it became unruly to scroll through and needed to find a way to make the list accessible. All cocktails are separated by base alcohol categories. There are exceptions for drinks that are equal parts - in which case go under a misc category.

* [Bourbon, Whiskey, Scotch](bourbon-whiskey/)
* [Misc., Equal Parts](misc/)
