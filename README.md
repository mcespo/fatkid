# Fatkid at Heart

Hi Marvin. Yes, I am talking to me. Here's the thing. You know full well that no one is really going to read through this project so you might as well make use of this readme. SO, you are using VuePress not for code documentation but to collect all of your cooking recipes onto some sort of online resource.

That rules. Be proud.

Better yet, you have this project ready to push onto Netlify whenever you publish to Master. Very boss. I love it, and I love you.

One note though (because there always is a catch). You need to remember how to actually work on this project because you seem to forget how to on like a weekly basis.

So here's all you need to know.

* This is the parent folder. The parent folder is used to make the connection between the VuePress project and Netlify. Any pushes or pulls into Master (as well as any additional branches for that matter) truly need to happen here.

* that `docs` directory you see there? That's where the actual project lives. CD into that mofo, run that `vuepress dev` command, and watch `http://localhost:8080` come to life.

Das it. Go forth and add moar content.
