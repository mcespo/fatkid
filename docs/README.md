# Welcome to Fatkid at Heart

Howdy, I'm Marvin, a web developer based in Chicago that likes to relieve stress by making junk in the kitchen. As such I have collected/created about 300 or so recipes on my phone and to be honest, I need to move those notes elsewhere. This site is a compilation of those recipes. Not all of them (if any) are here. A lot of my notes are for me, and the ones I've morphed into something readable will show up here in the coming weeks, months, or years. As this site _is_ currently a work in progress, please feel free to send your feedback or concerns to <a href="mailto:vice.president@whitehouse.gov?&subject=Vice%20President%20Michael%20Richard%20Pence,%20I%20have%20concerns&body=Sir,%20if%20I%20may,%20Marvin%20Cespedes'%20food%20blog%20needs..." title="Tell Marvin how you really feel">garbage@thedumpster.com</a>.

Love you. :two_hearts:

<!-- While I am still consolidating on how to best organize the content on this site, recipes are separated by food and drinks for my sanity. -->
