A well made quinoa is worth your quin... -sideration.

## Info

* Makes 1 cup of quinoa
* Prep Time: 5 minutes
* Cook Time: 40-45 minutes
* Total Time: 50 minutes

## Ingredients

### Items

* 180g (1 cup), quinoa
* 1 pinch, kosher salt
* 14g (1tbsp), olive oil
* 330ml (1Â½ cups), water

### Tools

* scale (or measuring spoons as needed)
* pot (I use a 2qt All-Clad pot)
* wooden or silicon spoon for mixing
* strainer
* stovetop

## Recipe

1. Begin by thoroughly rinsing **180g, quinoa** in water and strain as needed. Quinoa has a coating called saponin, which can make quinoa taste bitter, so please don't overlook this.

2. Transfer quinoa to a small pot and set to a low-med heat. Mix and allow the rinsed quinoa to dry and start to slightly toast.

3. Add **1 pinch, kosher salt** and **14g, olive oil** to quinoa and slightly stir before incorporating **330ml, water**.

4. Let water come to a boil while occasionally stirring. Once a boil begins to build, cover the quinoa and set the fire to low.

5. Let the covered quinoa sit on a low fire for 20 minutes.

6. Uncover, and fluff quinoa before serving.
