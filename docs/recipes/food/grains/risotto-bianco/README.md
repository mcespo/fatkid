## Recipe

1. Set up your _mise en place_ - Measure out your rice (for risottos, your rice should either remain dry or barely washed as that starch is going to be key). Divide your butter (**50g** now, **30g** for much later). Finely dice **1/2** Spanish onion, and **1** celery stick.  Set up one pot that can hold up to **800ml** of stock that you will set to a simmer (do this now). Set up a wide saucepan or larger pot on medium heat.

2. On your saucepan, add **50g** butter and **30g** olive oil. The butter should immediately start melting. Stir. Once the butter has melted, add fully diced **1/2** Spanish onion, and **1** celery stick to the pan. Stir again.

3. After a few minutes, you should spot the onions become slightly translucent. At this point, add **200g** rice. Stir even more until you notice the rice start to sizzle, and the rice itself becomes slightly translucent with a white center.

4. Add in **120ml** white wine (1/2 cup) to the saucepan. The wine is going to provide acidity to the dish. Stir until you see most of the wine get absorbed by the rice.

5. Now the fun begins. Risotto is so pleasant and easy to make but surprisingly just as easy to fuck up. At this point, your pot of stock should be warm - a cold stock will reduce the temperature of our saucepan, which would be bad. Using a ladle, try to incorporate about 2/3 cup of stock into the rice. As you stir, the rice should absorb a decent amount of the stock. If you streak your wooden spoon through the saucepan and notice it exposes the bottom of the pan for a second before the starchy liquid covers it up, then ladle in 2/3 cup of stock.

2. Preheat the oven to **165°C / 350°F**.

3. In a glass bowl, whisk together **170g** cake flour, **5g** baking powder, **1g** baking soda, and **2g** salt. Set flour mix aside.

4. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat **112g** eggs with the whisk attachment on medium speed for about 15-20 seconds.

5. Add **154g** sugar and continue to beat on medium speed for 30 seconds.

6. Add **7g?** vanilla extract and **112ml** oil and beat on medium speed for 1 minute.

7. Reduce mixer speed to medium/low and slowly add about half of the flour mixture, mixing until incorporated. Add half of the buttermilk and mix until incorporated. Add reminder of flour mixture until incorporated. Add the remainder of buttermilk until incorporated. Beat until just combined and smooth, scraping down the sides of the mixing bowl as needed. The batter will be thin and liquidy.

8. Pour batter into a lined cupcake pan. Ensure you only fill the liners with batter halfway! NEVER overfll the cupcakes. thats some rookie shit, so don't do it.

9. Bake for **12-14 minutes** at **165°C / 350°F** or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Once done, let them cool in the pan for a couple minutes, then remove. Note: if baking mini cupcakes, bake 10-12 minutes.
